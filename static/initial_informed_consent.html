      <h2> PURPOSE </h2>
      <div id="purpose-text">
	<h3>The purpose of this study is</h3>
	<p>
	  To document and analyze the practice of national-level
	  Internet censorship through the creation of a global network
	  of researchers running censorship measurement software.
	  This measurement software will run tests from your computer
	  or dedicated hardware device which attempt to access a list
	  of sensitive URLs. The software will collect data from these
	  tests and send it back to servers hosted at the University
	  of Toronto which are maintained by the researchers. Data
	  will be analyzed at Stony Brook University.  These data will
	  be used to determine what content is being censored, what
	  technical methods are used for censorship and how censorship
	  changes over time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is anticipated that there will be 15 subjects in the
	  study overall. It is not anticipated that any will enroll at
	  SBUStony Brook University. You are eligible to participate
	  in this research if you have a computer that meets the
	  softwareâ€™s minimum requirements and you have signed this
	  consent form.

      <h2> PROCEDURES </h2>
      <div id="procedures-text">
	<h3>If you decide to be in the study, your part will involve:</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Downloading a software client and installing it on to
	    your computer. This should take approximately 5 minutes
	    and only needs to be done once.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Running the software on your computer. The software will
	    run as a background process on your computer. It will run
	    tests for network censorship which may take up to one
	    hour, but do not require your interaction.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Uninstalling the software should you decide to no longer
	    participate in the project.
	  </li>

      <h2>RISKS / DISCOMFORTS</h2>
      <div id="risk-text">
	<h3>The following risks/discomforts may occur as a result of
	you being in this study:</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Your ISP or network administrator may be able to see the
	    list of websites being accessed by the measurement
	    software. There is a risk that accessing such websites and
	    running these tests violates network policies.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    There is a risk that accessing these sensitive websites is
	    in violation of local laws or regulations.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  The potential risks posed by conducting these tests are
	  highly specific to the context in which the tests take
	  place. These risks are highly dependent on the domestic
	  political and legal context in your country.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The data that the tool will collect are regularly
	  transmitted on the Internet and the measurement tests do not
	  compromise, circumvent or otherwise disrupt the regular
	  functioning of the networks being probed. While we know of
	  no explicit laws that forbid the collection of network
	  measurements on Internet censorship, the nature of this
	  research can potentially have political impacts and could be
	  seen unfavorably by certain authorities. If an authority is
	  sensitive to information of its censorship regime being
	  exposed and views exposure as potentially damaging then
	  nationals of that country who are found to be engaged in
	  this study may be scrutinized by the authorities.
	</p>
	<p>
	  While it is challenging to definitively identify what the
	  risks of conducting these tests may be in your country, we
	  have compiled a number of metrics to help inform you of the
	  potential risks in your country.
